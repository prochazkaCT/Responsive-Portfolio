# Responsive-Portfolio

Hello! I realized after looking at the images in the homework file that I did not do this assignment correctly the first time around. Thus, I am submitting a better responsive site (not perfect!) â€“ I struggled with getting the sidebar to center when you minimize the screen. Thanks and slack with any questions.
